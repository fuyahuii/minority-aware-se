[seeker] School work is just pounding my brain. [seeker] I am taking 5 courses this semester, too. [supporter] I can definetely imagine how stressful the last week of school can be, especially taking 5 courses instead of 4. [supporter] However, don't let this situation scare you or ruin  your holidays. There are ways to cope with said stress. [seeker] Yeah.  I am glad you are here to help me think things through. [seeker] I need to find a solution to my anxiety while I knock out paper after paper. [supporter] First of all, do you have some academic counselor you can talk to? Help you organize your ideas or classwork? Can you refer to professors or fellow classmates for help? [seeker] Well, counselors are hard to get ahold of so close to the Holidays.  The so-called teachers are not that helpful. [seeker] seniors must figure it out by themselves.....(for the most part). [seeker] My roommate is a lunatic. [supporter] Are you confident in your abilities to succeed in those classes or you think you might lack the materials or knowledge? Or perhaps time? [seeker] I just don't know.  I am going to try my best to submit every assignment on time, even though the quality prolly won't be 100%. [seeker] I am a perfectionist by nature. [seeker] I am a bit moody and my roommates have noticed it. [supporter] It's okto be moody given the circumstances and the stress you are going through, and I think that you should attemp to complete all the assignments even if you don't get a 100% on them. [supporter] That will show the professors that you are responsible and care about the subject or perhaps your major. [seeker] I think that I need to research more to ace this out. [supporter] Accomplishing to submit everything will also make you feel good with yourself! [supporter] It's important than you take your time. [seeker] Most so-called professors are snobs and their TA's are worse. [seeker] Academia is full of lazy admins and lame teachers.  Plus, the student loan costs are atrocious. [supporter] I understand that college can be financially demanding. [seeker] It is a rip off for what you get..... [seeker] Hopefully, my student loans will be forgiven by President Joe Biden in 2021 [seeker] My anxiety is from the costs of college as well. [supporter] You need to think that you will have a secure job once you graduate, and every debt will be eventually paid off even if Biden doesn't forgive it. [supporter] Try to remain optimistic and shake away the anxiety, it won't do you
 any good. [seeker] Yeah, but big debts are big debts [supporter] Do you feel better after talking about all of this? [seeker] Yeah, but do you think I should take a different approach to things? [seeker] Or find some other way to release my anxiety? [seeker] I am still anxious about the end of school [supporter] Not at all, I think what you are experiencing is completely normal, and you just have to cope with it in the most optimistic way possible. Maybe getting your assignments done in time will be helpful for your anxiety. After that, you will have tons of time to spend with friends, family, or simply leisure time to do what you enjoy.",3,A,"Step 1: The seeker's underlying goal is to find effective ways to manage their anxiety and academic pressure during finals week while feeling understood and supported.

Thank you for your help. [supporter] I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. [seeker] Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? [supporter] I would be subtle about that tactic. [supporter] If you haven't met any of his school mates. I wouldn't pursue that option.  Have you met any of his class mates?

How are you feeling today? [seeker] I am feeling frustrated. I have been looking for an alternate place to live, but I have not been able to find a place that I can afford that is close to my work. [supporter] I know sometime it's really frustrating. I am pretty sure you will definitely able to find one. [seeker] My partner said that if I do not move out, they will put my clothes and belonging outside and change the locks. I am very upset about that. [supporter] May I know your requirements for the place other than closer to work? would you like to share the accommodation? [seeker] i do not have much besides my clothes and a dresser. I would prefer to live alone, but I would consider a roommate. [supporter] I am really sorry to know about that. Your partner should understand your situation. [seeker] My partner understands my situation and how difficult it is for me to find another place to live, but they do not care. [supporter] You should search online or ask your friends or family for help if you they live nearby. [seeker] I have no friends. I discovered this when I started to break up with my partner. What I called my friends have turned out to be their friends instead. [seeker] i am from Texas and my family live there. [supporter] It is really hard to find a good place to live. Time and money are sometime the big constraints but we should keep trying. [seeker] I do not have a mother or father still living, just a sister. [seeker] I am running out of time to find a place to live, and I have a small amount of money saved up. I do not think that I have enough for a deposit. [supporter] It is always hard to find true friends. You must be a strong person and I know you can achieve anything. [seeker] My partner said that I have until the January 1 before he will change the locks. [supporter] Believe in yourself and don't give up. Definitely some solution will be around. [seeker] I work in the restaurant industry as a waiter and I have been laid off. I have not worked since October. [seeker] I live in a large city and rent is expensive. I feel sad about this. [supporter] I am really sorry to hear about that. I also got laid off and was worried, then I start searching online work. Found it and doing it now. Hope it will work for you too. [seeker] Sometimes I do not feel like it is worth my effort. I have a hard time getting out of bed. I tend to sleep a lot. [supporter] At this tough time we need to stay motivated and keep trying. [seeker] i appreciate your kind words. I feel very alone. [supporter] I really like talking to you, hope it will help you in staying positive. [seeker] I was speaking with my sister on the phone last weekend and she said that I should go to the doctor. [seeker] Unfortunately, I do not have insurance. I called and they said it would cost over $200 for an initial visit. [seeker] I am not sure about my options. [supporter] There is no harm in taking doctors advice. Sorry to here about that. you can try online counselling. there are so many website offering free counselling sessions. you can search on google [seeker] I have not thought about online counselling, I have been focused on trying to find somewhere else to live. I will look online. [supporter] I would suggest follow your routine, stay motivated and keep looking to for the new place. Sometime sitting with the partner and having conversation with the person might help. [seeker] I do not understand why my partner wants me to leave. I came suddenly one day about 2 months ago. [seeker] The whole break up probably has to do with drug addiction. I know that I have a problem. [supporter] Have you ever tried to quit this habit or had counselling before? [supporter] That might be the reason.  It is not impossible to quit it. you just need bit guidance. [seeker] I want to stop, but I am afraid. A couple years ago, I overdosed and was in the hospital for about a month. It is difficult for me to talk about it. [seeker] I need drugs to feel normal. It's sad. [supporter] I can understand is is not that easy. Time is really tough right now. We as human being nothing is impossible for us to do. Problem like  drugs can be quitted if we stay strong and determined.  It is hard to say that drugs can not make us normal. [supporter] I can understand your situation.

449,Previous Experience,anger,breakup with partner,A person I was dating broke up with me in a terrible manner.,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,"[seeker] My boyfriend broke up with me. [supporter] Hello there, how are you? [seeker] I'm very upset. [seeker] He yelled and yelled at me. [supporter] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? [supporter] That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. [seeker] Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree [seeker] He said I was worthless. [supporter] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! [seeker] Well that's good for you, but I'm so mad right now I can't see straight! [supporter] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. [seeker] I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. [supporter] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? [supporter] How long were the two of you together? [seeker] More than a year, but I've known him since childhood. [seeker] That's what makes me so mad! [supporter] He should not be treating you that way when you've known one another so long! [seeker] All those years of friendship down the drain. [seeker] Should I call him? [supporter] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better [seeker] But all of my friends are still friends with him! [seeker] And they took his side! [supporter] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. [seeker] How did you get through it? [supporter] They all took his side? Not one took yours? [seeker] Not one! [supporter] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class .. that was a great way to meet new people [seeker] I'm not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. [supporter] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? [seeker] He's a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. [supporter] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly [seeker] But maybe I deserved it. [supporter] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly [seeker] Yes, he did. [supporter] No you did not! Please don't think like that [seeker] I'm just so angry that I could break something. [seeker] And maybe I will do that! [supporter] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. [supporter] There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this [seeker] But what if it doesn't pass? [seeker] And I cannot afford therapy. [supporter] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now [supporter] There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free [seeker] I don't know if I could do that. I don't like talking about my problems with strangers. [supporter] And yet here we are :P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found. [supporter] I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was [seeker] Do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people I don't know? [supporter] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No-one will be judging you [seeker] That's what I am afraid of. Being judged by people. [supporter] Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem? [seeker] Probably. He called me a lot of names. [supporter] The important thing is to gradually rebuild your self esteem. Do you have any things that you excel at? [seeker] I'm good at bowling. And I like riding horses. [supporter] Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends? [seeker] Maybe I will do that. Horses are so cool. [supporter] I can feel that you are starting to make progress already and are thinking of things that you can do post break up [seeker] I sure am. Thanks for your help.

I know this will be incredibly hard, but I wouldn't want to see you getting sick and suffering as a result of his infidelity. [supporter] No, we were not married.

[seeker] I'm afraid I might be in the next round. [supporter] I am very sorry to hear that. I am currently in a situation where furloughs are greatly affecting my family as well. [seeker] Oh no that's terrible. [seeker] The problem is, I am right now the only breadwinner in the family. My wife was laid off three months ago [supporter] Are you given specifics on time of furlough? [seeker] No, it's basically until things get better. [supporter] I know that's very difficult.

They should respect that. [seeker] Maybe it is my fault, maybe I didn't communicate enough. [supporter] Is this a relationship you would want back if you could get it back? [seeker] No, I don't think I'd want to get back with someone who cheated on me. [supporter] I would agree with you on that! That was how I felt too.

Sometimes, the best relationships occur when people work through the most difficult occurrences in their relationship. Have you tried talking to her? I would recommend talking to her when your emotions have settled. [seeker] guessed you right, i just don't know if i can trust her, I don't think i can heal from the betrayer [supporter] I would make a pros and cons list. If there are a lot of pros, I think it's worth a shot! Just give yourself time to process everything that has happened. You don't want to sit down and talk to her and let all your emotions come out. That could cause more harm. Just make a list and you'll have a better understanding of which direction you should go with your relationship! [seeker] i understand, its just hard to trust when the trust is broken, hard to know what direction to turn to, forgive her or move on, to choose is just a hard decision. Guess i need to hear her own part of the story [supporter] Yes. Give it time. Wait to hear her story. Make your pros and cons list. And see where to go from there. Be easy on yourself. It's okay to have hard days. Just give yourself time to heal from the hurt! [seeker] I try working towards that, i just wish am back to myself soon because it has really affected me. [supporter] I am sure it has! Try to spend time with friends and family that can be there for you during this time. You need to lean on people when things get hard like this! [seeker] wished i have friends i could trust, all just mock and wished you worse, hated being alive [supporter] That's awful! You need better friends than that!! What about your family? [seeker] Guess I'll go stay with them till i can get myself together [supporter] That's a great idea! Family can be super helpful for you during this time!!

[supporter] Oh?  How come so tired? [seeker] Because I can't sleep... I don't know what's wrong with me I just lay there awake for hours! [supporter] Oh I have had trouble sleeping before!   Would you like to know what helped me? [seeker] Yes please, I'm desperate, I'll try anything! [supporter] First of all, fixed sleep and wake times.   If you toss and turn for hours, still get up at the same time.   Eventually your body will tire and sleeping will naturally become easier. [seeker] I have to always get up for work so I am sticking to the same routines, I just lie in bed with so many thoughts racing around my head and I just can't get off to sleep [supporter] Second thing I do is I have a wind down routine.   No work past a certain time, no matter what.   Only soft music, pleasant movie, some light reading, and dim the lights.   It slows your body down before sleep.  It will help slow that racing thoughts you are having. [seeker] I did try reading a book last night, but I don't really have lights that I can dim, it's just the one bright light in our room. [supporter] I have had racing thoughts and it used to drive me up the wall! [supporter] Can you buy a lamp?  Even a second hand one if your budget is tight? [seeker] Yeah, it's just so annoying and then I'm so tired and irritable the next day, I find myself snapping at everyone. [supporter] The bright light will keep your mind stimulated. [seeker] I could buy a lamp I suppose, to see if it helps? But when I am awake all night it's in the dark so I'm not sure if the light is the problem> [supporter] Aw so you are so exhausted from racing thoughts and not enough sleep the night before that you end up taking it out on others, but not meaning to.  Am I understanding correctly? [supporter] Do you get any exercise?  I sleep better on days I go for walks, and my sedentary days I sleep worse, it's quite clear to me. [seeker] I have been trying to do lots of walks, I need to lose weight as well so they kind of go hand in hand! [seeker] I do also have back pain so that's another thing that doesn't help! [supporter] Good effort, keep it up! [supporter] Back pain, I know all about that too unfortunately.  How is your mattress? [seeker] Yeah it's a pretty good mattress, but it is a few years old now, I'm not sure how often you're supposed to replace them? [supporter] Hmm I can't recall, I can't afford to replace mine regularly enough lol.  Maybe google it? [seeker] Yeah maybe, at this point it's worth looking into anything that could help! [supporter] Do you have someone to talk to about the thoughts that are racing? [supporter] If they are worries, maybe a counsellor would help. [seeker] Not really, I don't really have any friends and my boyfriends a bit weird about stuff like this, I can't really talk to him about things like this. [seeker] Yeah maybe, I have been considering a counsellor myself. [supporter] Hmm that's a challenge not having friends.   Have been there too! [seeker] And I don't know how to go about finding new ones! I don't think I'm someone people like to be friends with, I try to make friends but they always move on. [supporter] I don't want to give you a huge barrage of suggestions but another thing that helps me is a podcast called Tracks to Relax. [seeker] Sounds interesting, I'll have to look it up! [supporter] Well maybe you just haven't met the right people yet.  It takes time finding someone we click with [seeker] That's true, maybe they weren't meant to be my friends. Anyway, thank you so much for your help but I have to shoot off. [supporter] It's probably not you!   When people drift away from me I always say to myself ""Oh well, their loss!""

1177,Current Experience,depression,problems with friends,"My neighbors are all mad at me, because I was the cause of a mutual friend being evicted from our complex.  Her dog attacked my dog and another dog within a week.  I reported the incident to apartment management and Animal Control.  She was told to get rid of her dog or move.  She elected to move, but continued to say that she ""got kicked out because of me"".  I guess friends liked her more, because now I'm the ""bad guy"".",3,5.0,4.0,2.0,"[supporter] Hello! How are you doing today? [seeker] It's a pretty day, but I'm sad.  How are you? [supporter] I'm doing well, thank you for asking! Do you mind me asking what's going on that's making you feel sad? [seeker] I don't like being blamed for something when I don't feel I did anything wrong.  A neighbor's dog attacked my dog and another dog within a week and I reported it to our apartment manager and animal control.  She was given the choice to get rid of her dog or move and she decided to move.  But my neighbors are mad at me, because they think I overreacted.  I guess they liked her more. [supporter] It sounds like you feel as though you are being personally attacked/mistreated for something that you feel you handled correctly. Does that summarize what you're feeling?

Are you on good terms with the other person whose dog was attacked? [seeker] I totally agree with you!  The woman is disabled and I think most of the neighbors feel sorry for her.  I've seen her loose control of the dog before, but she never attacked another dog(s).  I've even seem the dog pull her scooter over and the woman needed lots of help to get back into it.  I think everyone feels sorry for her. [supporter] That probably has a lot to do with it. I would feel sorry for her too, as it is very sad in general. However, it doesn't excuse the fact that her animal attacked two other dogs. [seeker] I've talked to the neighbors face-to-face and they just think that I overreacted.  The woman started getting her dog and private training and so they feel that she was trying.  My point was that my dog weighs 15 pounds and her dog weighs 45 pounds and, if it happens again, I may not have a dog anymore.  I don't want to wait until a dog is killed or badly injured.  I told them exactly what you just said, but they are being mean! [seeker] I guess I could try talking to them again.  Maybe they've cooled off some. [supporter] That is absolutely terrible. In that case, I would just tell them that you refuse to allow another dog to possible injure or kill your own dog, so you did what was necessary to protect your fur-baby. Had you not done anything, this could have happened again, and the outcome may have been much worse. At that point, if they still don't respond kindly, I'd tell them that you still feel as though you did what needed to be done, that you understand why they are upset, but that you will always do whatever it takes to protect your dog. Hopefully, they will stop being mean. Even if they just stop talking to you completely, it's better than them harassing you or something along those lines. If they do start escalating their nasty behavior, I'd let the manager of your complex know that you're being mistreated. I always try to keep things calm and quiet, but I refuse to be taken advantage of or treated poorly. [supporter] Personally, as I stated previously, I wholeheartedly believe that you did the right thing. If they're unable to see that, I'd try to just avoid contact with them unless it's necessary. I know it stinks and I'd be sad too, but unfortunately, some people just don't know how to let things go and seem to find joy in making other people upset.

[supporter] I know it may be difficult to remain patient when your friend repeatedly does this, but maybe you could explain to her that it makes you feel like she is mistrustful of your opinion when she second guesses your taste in friends. [seeker] Yes, I know. Until she finds her self worth, it doesn't matter what any of her friends say to her. [seeker] I have actually told her that. That it seems like she doesn't trust me. [supporter] Possibly explaining it in a way she can relate to would be helpful. [supporter] I did in fact speak with my friend and it helped our relationship quite a bit.

Just from chatting with you, I can feel how anxious you are. [supporter] It sounds like you don't feel heard by your boss. [seeker] Sort of. I feel they have no communication or empathy for their employees. How can a company who is making their staff redundant expect them to work harder?

Do you think that will help? [supporter] I believe you deserve to be treated fairly. I hear that you also believe that you deserve to be treated fairly. Calling a hotline or talking to a human resource profession is a suggestion. [seeker] I think that's a good idea, I will try that. What kind of things should I say? [supporter] Expressing your feelings about the companies redundancies. Also, your feelings about the company having no communication or empathy for their employees.

[supporter] I tried to focus on other areas of my life and to critically reflect on my relationship. Largely, I threw myself into my work and tried to better that aspect of my life, and hung out with people that I knew cared about me. Both of those are very good distractions which you might be able to use. [seeker] Maybe calling off work was a bad idea...  all I'm going to do is think about this instead of doing something to take my mind off of it... [supporter] I think one day off to get the crying out of your system is a good emotional cleanse. We all need time to self care and look after our emotions. Maybe going for a walk or doing some yoga, to place your focus on something rather than being boxed into a room may help to shift your focus.
