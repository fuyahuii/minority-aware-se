[supporter] I am so sorry to hear that. You have probably become very attached after that long, I can imagine. [seeker] Yes, I am worried that he wont be taken care of.  I am worried that he wont be happy. [seeker] I cook for him and take him outside.  I grow fruit so he can eat it. [supporter] Can I ask why you have to give him up? Do you have any other pets? [seeker] NO other pets.  I have gone leaglly blind, had to give up driving.  I have to move to a condo from a single famuly home.  He is too loud to live in a condo. [supporter] You are a very good caretaker for your parrot. You have given him a lot of specialized care. [seeker] Going blind is bad enough, giving up driving was teh worst.  But giving up my parrot is really hard. [seeker] I did baby him, he can go outside through the dggie door.  He gets fresh fruit, spaghettie,  He has his own Alexa. [supporter] You have been the best you could be for him and it has got to feel really sad to let him go. It can feel like a death sometimes when you lose someone or a pet. [seeker] If he died it would be OK, I would mourn him and move on.  But I have never had to give up a pet before.  I just think most people. wont take care of him like I do. Because he is still alive, I will worry about him [supporter] I understand a little bit of how you feel. My dog died recently and it was really hard when the vet had to put him down. I was really sad and would cry when I thought of him ort the things we used to do together. [seeker] Yes, I was depressed for 6 months after my parrot died, but eventually we move on.  I dont know that I can move on after giving him up [supporter] Would you ever consider getting a pet that is not as loud? I am not suggesting that you replace him. [seeker] No, except a seeing dog [supporter] I am concerned that if you don't have a pet to care for you may have a more difficult time to recover and thrive.
