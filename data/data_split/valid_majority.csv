It seems at times that you put in all the work and that it's one-sided. Does that sound about right? [seeker] You are absolutely correct and this is someone I care so much about [supporter] This must be very hard on you. [supporter] How does this make you feel? [seeker] Oh it is very depressing, have known her for a very long time about 16years now [supporter] Sixteen years is a long time. I recently when through a similar situation with a friend.

I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, I just don't feel comfortable approaching her.

I have been quarantined for 5 weeks with COVID-19 (tested positive), so I am getting cabin fever. [supporter] Ready for the holidays [supporter] So you tested positive, must be hard [seeker] I am starting to get an aversion to holidays.  When I was in college, my father was dying, and Thanksgiving was the last meal he ate at the family table...
Christmas was the last time he ate solid food,
and he died on the day after Epiphany [seeker] So I have come to associate Thanksgiving through January as a time of loss. [supporter] The holidays can bring back memories, but you have other family around right [seeker] This month has driven it home more, because I have had six people die this month.  It's starting to bring on flashbacks. [seeker] No, my family all moved from the area.  The nearest is now half a country away and hasn't spoken to me in over ten years. [supporter] The virus is hard. along with the season [seeker] It's been... interesting. [supporter] You must have friends around, right. have you contacted any [supporter] How long ago did your dad pass away [seeker] Ahhh... I hate to be that guy, but I really don't have that many friends.  I have a couple people at my church who have checked in, but I wouldn't go so far as to call them friends (we don't hang out, I don't get invited over...) [seeker] I was in college.  He died slowly and painfully.  It was really unpleasant. [seeker] And he was a brilliant man.  I could only wish to be half of what he was. [supporter] That can cause loneliness as well. What about seeing if your family will chat and let them know you ae ok [seeker] I don't even have contact information for them anymore.  The last known phone numbers have been disconnected and the last time I sent mail, it was returned for wrong address, no forwarding information known. [seeker] I think they forgot about me. [supporter] Comparing yourself to others can be a positive and give you reason to strive more [seeker] The only one I still have contact with is my mother. [supporter] Have you checked to see if she is ok [seeker] I avoid comparing myself to others.  I usually come out on the bad side of it. [seeker] I talk to her regularly.  She is okay, but I fear she is reaching the age where I know I won't have her much longer. [supporter] But use your dad as inspiration [seeker] I'm just thankful I have had her this long [seeker] That I do.  While I will never have the skills my father had technically, I am thankful that I did get his ability to be analytical and his compassion for others. [supporter] See that is a positive thing. You both need each other [supporter] That is great to hear. He is a role model  for you [seeker] Absolutely.  I still remember him teaching me things that I use to this day.  I still smile when I think of one time when he first became ill and couldn't get out of bed... [seeker] there was a project he wanted to do and it bothered him that it had not gotten done.  Well, I was able to do it, because he had taught me enough to know what to do. [supporter] That is a positive in itself. Keep his legacy going through you [seeker] The look of pride in his face was priceless. [supporter] And you have that memory to live by [seeker] The one thing I carry on because of him is my love for my church.  He was on the church vestry (governing board).  I am on my church worship team. [supporter] His smile is in your heart and you can still feel him [seeker] I actually made church history, because I sing with the praise team (some churches call that a choir), but I sing many of the songs in American Sign Language. [seeker] I am the first signing member of the church. [supporter] See that there in itself is a reason to smile [seeker] 2021 will be the 50 year anniversary of our congregation. [seeker] I joined just over ten years ago. [seeker] My church is my anchor. [supporter] You are a positive for your church. Not many can sign language [seeker] My pastor is wonderful.  He is like the little brother I didn't have but always wanted. [supporter] That is awesome. See you have a purpose [supporter] I imagine he is missing his big sister [seeker] My favorite story about signing in the church is how it began...  I had asked to do it and had been shot down cold six times.  Well, I laugh now, but at the time I was angry. [seeker] If you mean me, I'm male.

[supporter] God placed you there for that little girl [seeker] From that point on, there was no problem with me signing in church. [seeker] I think He placed her there for me, also.  It was a mutual deal. [seeker] There is no one in my congregation at the moment who signs, but I keep hoping for the future. [supporter] You have a calling on your life. Don't let the dream die [seeker] No.  That mission has been placed on my heart. [supporter] He will use you in mighty ways [seeker] Well... I should be going, but thank you for taking the time to chat. [supporter] Ok. Hope I was of help [supporter] I am a Christian also [seeker] You definitely were.  I am feeling better than I have in about a mo
nth.  I appreciate that. [seeker] God put you here tonight for a reason [supporter] God loves you. [seeker] Of this I have no doubt. [supporter] Glad  iI was here. [seeker] I am actually in the process of studying catechism with my pastor, and plan to be re-confirmed. [supporter] Live the dream and seek Him always [seeker] I was confirmed in a different denomination as a child, but I learned nothing.  One day I realized that I have no knowledge of the faith, and that did not sit well with me. [supporter] Be Blessed for He lives inside of you [seeker] So I am changing that and not just paying lip service to Jesus, but actively seeking Him. [supporter] Are you saved [seeker] Absolutely. [supporter] Seek Him everyday [supporter] He is my 1st in the morning [seeker] I was not always.  I drifted a few years back.  My church family gave me a gift and sent me to a religious retreat at a resort owned by my church denomination.  It was there and in that moment that I came back to God. [supporter] God has away to bring His sheep back. He knew you and did not give up on you [supporter] I fell away for 15 years, but He opened my eyes. [seeker] I try to go each year, as it's an annual retreat.  I missed this year because of COVID, but hoping for next year.  I was going to take a friend from out of state.  He couldn't attend due to the pandemic.  But if all goes well, next year will be different. [seeker] It was about 15 years for me, as well. [seeker] I was never far away, just not close enough, if you know what I mean. [supporter] Your a gift from God to the world [seeker] I left my childhood church because it turned into a false church, and it no longer teaches God's word. [seeker] I still pray for them daily that they can realize what they are doing, repent and turn it around. [supporter] We were always close but He knew the time to bring you home [supporter] Even though we are locked down can you sign online for a church [seeker] It took years to find a church that God wanted me to be with, but I have found my church family, and I love them.  I am closer to my church family than I am to blood relatives. [supporter] Does your church have online services [seeker] Due to technical issues, I can't sign for my church, but I do have the pleasure of streaming the service each week, so I can still see my pastor, hear his message, and worship. [supporter] So you are still plugged in the church [seeker] Because of the way the feed is set up, I can not participate unless I am at the church building, and I need to wait until I am clear of the COVID infection first. [supporter] My church is miles away but I still hear the message every Sunday [seeker] I watch the service live each week.  Actually, I have told the pastor I have gotten spoiled and like the online streaming because I can watch the service again, later. [seeker] There are days when I am closed up in my room wanting to feel sorry for myself that I take great comfort in watching the service again. [supporter] Can you send messages so the church knows you r ok [seeker] I do, and my pastor is wonderful about chatting with me on Facebook every day or so. [seeker] Just a couple weeks ago, he brought me a giant care package full of food and snacks to help keep me going and relieve the boredom. [supporter] can you sign language the service and send it back for the church to reach others [seeker] No...  I'm not fluent enough for that.  I do the songs because I can research them and practice ahead. [seeker] I can't interpret. [supporter] Do u have away to record the service and sign language. Sign language the songs [seeker] I am blessed to have friends who give me technical advice.  I have a friend who is a certified interpreter who has sent me video showing me the correct way to sign certain songs. [supporter] So you have a way to sign for others. [seeker] At the moment, I have no way, but that's okay.  Since there is no one in the congregation who signs at the moment, I am not needed in that role. [supporter] You are Just like that little girl [seeker] I have no doubt if there were someone depending on me to get the message across, God would have shown us a way to get me streamed in.

[seeker] In fact I have been on sick leave from work since it started. My partner is understanding to a point but yes, I'll need to provide once this is all over.

I guess I just have to find another way to cope [supporter] If you have financial issues and you need the help from a therapist you deserve the treatment. One thing you can do is apply for Medicaid and EBT. The state you live in will give you money to pay for groceries and to get help from a therapist for free if you don't have a high enough income. It may be worth looking into because all you really need to do is fill out some forms and likely you will be approved. When I was younger and struggling, this had happened to me and I received both of these benefits and it totally turned my life around. I think it can do the same for you as well. [seeker] I'm on Medicare and supplemental insurance. I didn't know you can, possibly, see one for free. I'll look into that. That is helpful. [supporter] Sure thing. What are some of the coping strategies you've been practicing with your prior therapist? [seeker] I asked him to help me with some but all he would say is that I should stop vaping (I switched from smoking some years ago). I told him it feels like I'm walking a tightrope and he's suggesting I get rid of the safety net without giving me something else, some other way to cope. He said that's not what a therapist is supposed to do and that my resistance shows I don't really want to change. [supporter] I can see how that comment he made would be frustrating. If you feel like vaping, you should continue to do; however, what happens if say you go somewhere and find yourself in a stressful position? What would be strategy you could use in order to recenter yourself? Strategies are important as they balance us when we experience stressors that through us off. Have you ever thought about meditation? [seeker] I asked him about meditation and if he could recommend something. He wouldn't. I have only been able to do it successfully once, at the meditation gardens when I visited my son in San Diego some years back. Since I can't always get to that kind of natural setting, I was hoping he could give me some resources. Do you know of any place I can find some? [supporter] Oh yes. Me personally, I like to scour youtube and find an environment with a sound I enjoy such as the beach. When I listen to that sound, I try to put myself by closing my eyes while sitting on the floor and breathing deeply for some time. It may be worth a try for you. I hope it helps you. Good luck!

[seeker] I have been better. I am really stressed and feel like I am at a breaking point. [supporter] I am sorry to hear you are near your breaking point, do you have any idea when the decline and stress began? [seeker] It began a few weeks ago. I have had a really intense project that is on a time crunch. I feel like I am overwhelmed and unable to balance work and personal life. [supporter] Work and personal life are very hard to juggle with each other, especially in the current life situations around the globe.  I am sure you will successfully handle both in the overall. [seeker] What should I do to help feel like I can manage and push through? Right no w i feel like giving up. [supporter] For me, when I start getting overwhelmed and need to ""debrief"" my mind, and ""declutter"" the stresses, I use a notepad. I jot down every detail I can that pops into mind. Every upcoming task, everything that has caused anxiety or similar, and then I prioritize them in an agenda. It seems tedious, however once you get a handle on scheduling, in my personal ex
perience, it is easier to hold yourself accountable and slowly work your way through accomplishments, even small tasks, which is encouraging to continue. [supporter] Sometimes, something as small as an 
accomplished task can uplift a mood greatly. Especially when listed and checked off to see the progress. [seeker] Thank you. That seems helpful.

1039,Current Experience,anxiety,ongoing depression,Worried about my daughter abd her academic struggles. She has a genetic condition and some learning differences. Struggling to cope to work and do day to day things and give her as much support as she needs.,4,5.0,5.0,3.0,"[supporter] Hello. How are you doing today? [seeker] Hi, I'm struggling today. [supporter] I'm sorry to hear that. Anything in particular that is bothering you? [seeker] I just feel worn out with everything I have to do. [seeker] I don't know what else I can d to help my daughter. [supporter] I understand that you are feeling worn out and don't know what else you can do to help your child. Is there something specific going on or is it just life in general? [seeker] My daughter struggles with school work and memory. She learns differently and needs lots of support. I have contacted the school a number of times over the years but never really had any support or acknowledgement from them. I guess it's just an accumulation of things. [supporter] You have tried hard to help her and that is admirable. Don't beat yourself up and be proud of the things you have done for her. [seeker] But what do I now. She's 17 and it's so difficult to give her the time and then  encourage her to tell me when she needs help and for her to be willing to accept it. [supporter] While I do not have kids, from what I have seen my friends and family do in this situation is try to find something that your daughter is interested in and attempt to build off of that. So instead of her learning to just learn, she is learning something that is relevant to her. Maybe that might spark something in her to come up with her way of learning since traditional methods aren't working. [seeker] That is great advice. She does climb and hasn't been able to climb or see her friends with everything closed. I think as she will be able to again soon may be that will help her to relax and get back into it. She does learn through repetition but has lacked enthusiasm especially in the last few months. [supporter] Having her go climbing more sounds like a good plan. Hopefully things are opening up around you now that the vaccine is becoming more common. [supporter] Repetition is tough. I know I used a lot of flash cards as a way of learning through high-school and college. It's an old method but it can work. [seeker] She had heart  surgery as a baby so has actually had the vaccine herself as she's in the vulnerable category.  I think she ends up spending so long making aide memoires that she then leaves herself so little time to actually study. [supporter] I can imagine after having heart surgery as a baby she wants to live life to it's fullest extent and prioritizes making memories over school. Does she ever talk about what her plans are for after high-school? At some point she will have to connect the dots of having to get a job to be able to go out and have fun, and unfortunately doing OK in school comes with that. That or a vocational school to learn a trade (what I personally did). [seeker] What did you do? Her interests are music and photography. Recently she has started a gardening club with the horticulture department at school. She does enjoy her social life well when she has been able to have it. She has had social ups and downs but apart from the epidemic she has been happier than in her earlier years at school. You are right she is becoming an adult and will find her place. At 17 I guess she doesn't have to decide just yet. [seeker] You have certainly made me feel a bit more positive. [supporter] Sorry for the delay. I am glad you are feeling more positive. I was into cars so I went to vocational school to become an auto mechanic. After a couple years of that I realized I wasn't cut out for physical labor and went to college. But the knowledge from working on cars helped me understand things better at college since I had real world applications I could use it on. [supporter] Gardening and Horticulture is a great hobby!

[seeker] Iam married for 7 years and have 2 kids..My partner never liked me and he only used me as a sexual toy .he is abusing me physically and sexually . [seeker] I feel like there is some one to share my pain and very badly need a shoulder to cry on. [seeker] I want to really go for some therapy to get out of sadness in my life. [seeker] i want to be there for my kids who are really a blessing from god. [seeker] I love to go back to my parents but they even dont look after me. [seeker] They worry about the society more than their own daughter. [supporter] Hello, I just connected. What do you want to talk about most? [seeker] I am seeking some emotional help with my depression [supporter] We can start over... It seems like you have having issues with managing depression. Is that so? [seeker] Iam a victim of domestic and sexual abuse by my partner.yes,I need some help [supporter] It is OK to ask for help. Many people do it every day. You deserve to be heard. [seeker] Yeah I have two beautiful kids,I just want to be there for them in their life. [supporter] You have a wonderful dedication to your children, I can tell. [seeker] Yeah also I am looking for some financial security for my kids future which is possible only with a job.. [supporter] You mentioned this before, but have you tried therapy sessions? [seeker] Yeah Iam looking to go for therapy ,but not able to find a therapist according to my budget. [supporter] There are many ways to find a mental health professional at little to no cost. Look in your network and see if you can find someone without a co-pay, or if you don't have insurance, you will be able to find people who provide services who use sliding pay scales. [seeker] Those are very helpful ideas..Thank you very much.I will try for sure. [supporter] You are welcome. Sometimes you will pay as little as 0-$20 a session. I've found this to be helpful in my life on multiple occasions. [seeker] Oh I didnt know that the therapy sessions are that inexpensive.I was in a opinion like they cost me 200 $for each session. [seeker] Any opinions that I can consider? [supporter] You have to find what is available. Avoid big buildings full of psychologists, usually the more independent practices are reasonable and provide better service IMO. [seeker] What kind of therapies are useful and beneficial to me in my situation. [supporter] Probably someone to talk to, so just a counselor or therapist fits the bill. I am not a doctor so don't take anything I say as medical advice btw. [seeker] Sure..That is very helpful..Can you suggest where to find some online forums to find survivors with my same condition.

[seeker] Not too great, honestly. [supporter] Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there something in particular that's wrong? [seeker] I am struggling to keep up with all of the assignments in my classes and I am anxious that I am going to fail some of them. [supporter] That sounds really stressful [seeker] It really is hard to manage [supporter] Are you in a program that lets you choose your own classes? [seeker] Three of them were required for majors in my year, unfortunately. [supporter] Oh, that's rough. I've had classes before where I had to take them but had a lot of trouble. [supporter] Do you know anyone in the class? Maybe you could try studying with them and see if they can help. [seeker] I have a couple friends in the same classes but there is so much material it is hard to find any time to get together. [supporter] It sounds like you're overwhelmed by all of the things expected of you [supporter] Sometimes schools have programs that can help with this sort of thing, like student support services, that might be able to get you extensions on assignments, or move tests around if they fall on a similar date. [seeker] That sounds like a great idea but I am not sure if they will have any sympathy for me. [supporter] You might be right, it depends on the school honestly. It might not hurt to try though if you're really overwhelmed. Another thought is to try talking to your professors or TAs? They might be more sympathetic than you think. [seeker] You're right. I guess it would be worth the time and effort to at least ask. That is probably better than just suffering. [supporter] I've been a TA for classes before, and even though I sometimes can't do too much to change assignment deadlines, I've always been open to talking to students about their struggles. It helps me to know who to keep an eye on and give extra attention to. [supporter] Are you feeling any external pressure from your family or advisor to do really well? [seeker] I don't really have much of a support system. I really am just trying to self motivate. [supporter] That sounds so hard, I think it's awesome that you're trying so hard on your own. Just the fact that you're in a program in the first place is really impressive. [seeker] Thank you.
