[seeker] She is 44! [seeker] Too old for all this nonsense. [seeker] She has a short temper.......I think I am going to have to separate myself from her for the duration of the virus and the cure. I cannot talk to her again unless she agrees to get vaccinated. [seeker] She is all to careless. [supporter] I see, it does sound like she is being negligent with her behavior and not respecting of you and your concern on this virus. When you say your friend does not believe in the virus, what is her stance on it? [seeker] She thought it was faked for political reasons at first. Then when she found out it was real when it struck close to home, she is saying it is apart of population control. Honestly she is all over the place. I find her very dangerous to others right now. [seeker] I don't think our friendship will survive this because I am willing to part ways for all of our safety. [seeker] I hate that but will do it.
\ [supporter] I can relate with your friend, at the beginning I had similar thoughts. As my friends started working on those units and my members being hospitalized for it, I surrendered my political stance and dawned my mask. I have a friend who is just like your friend, they have politicized it and had first degree exposure and blew up when we had her sit out of our teen support group/youth group and church services for two weeks. She is in her 50's. [supporter] I can relate with your friend, at the beginning I had similar thoughts.

[supporter] It sounds like you are very overwhelmed with the amount of work you have and having no break, correct? [seeker] it has been such a long year, i am just ready for things to improve. it is hard not having the usual coping mechanisms of socializing with friends or going out [seeker] yes, that is part of it. the work wouldn't seem so bad if there was somethign to look forward to but every day feels the same [supporter] When I start to feel alone and missing my family or friends, I usually like the plan a skype or group facetime session right after I get off of work. [seeker] i have tried to use zoom and facetime but video chat gives me anxiety [supporter] There are online resources to have some fun with friends too--many blogs suggest hosting a group game night or a shared movie night. [seeker] that does sound a little better [seeker] the winter makes it worse too, all the days are so dark 
and cold [supporter] I am sure with a bit of trial and error, hosting a movie or game night would be a breeze for you too! [seeker] i wish that i could spend more time outside, over the summer and fall it helped to get more fresh air and exercise [supporter] Having this winter sadness, especially around holiday times, may be a sign of seasonal depression. [seeker] i do usually experience depression in the winter and around the holidays. but the pandemic has made it harder to cope [supporter] I have had seasonal depression in the past, and going on nature hikes and bike rides has helped me a lot. [supporter] Maybe spending less time inside your home and grabbing some fresh air can relieve some of that anxiety and stress. [seeker] it hasn't been too cold to go out...now that the days will start getting longer maybe there will be more time to get outside [supporter] Research shows that physical activity greatly reduces stress! [supporter] It sounds like going out more would be very beneficial to you!",5,B

[seeker] Yeah, but even with the distribution, some people are saying that things won't return to normal till about late spring/early summer. [seeker] It's certainly maddening. [supporter] I know it's not easy, but try to think of this whole situation of a challenge that you are overcoming. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. You will come out of this ready for any hardships that life might throw at you. [seeker] I guess, I still think our responce to this was sloppy at best. I mean, lockdown the healthy masses due to a discease with a 99% survival rate? It just doesn't make sense in my book. I'm just glad this silliness will be over soon. [supporter] It will hopefully be over sooner than we think. [supporter] Just try to keep a positive attitude, focus on the things you like, and time will fly.

Because you have options, you will likely pick the choice that will be most fulfilling for you, in something you will be passionate about - so this will likely be very positive for you.",5,B

[seeker] What suggestions do you have for improving it? [seeker] Meditation? [seeker] Exercise? [seeker] I do art. And never have anxiety when I'm painting, however, I cannot exactly do that at the store [supporter] Have you thought about looking for support groups with people who also have anxiety about being in public? [seeker] I have and I did [supporter] Have you thought about brining a friend with you to the store? Someone you are comfortable with? Having someone you are comfortable with may help to calm the anxiety while you are out. [seeker] Support groups don't really help stop the Panic Attacks. They cause all sorts of sensations. Fast heart rate, chills, shakes, My brain feels foggy and impersonal. [seeker] I do go to the store often with my fiance :) [seeker] That has helped a lot [supporter] I have also had anxiety in the past when in public places, so I know how it feels to be anxious while out. [seeker] Yeah, it's definitely annoying. But it isn't JUST at the store. I was diagnosed with Panic Attack Disorder and even have attacks at home where I freak out. [seeker] It's been better since I was on medication but I never feel completely....normal [supporter] Another thing that may help is having some headphones in attached to your phone or an MP3 player so you can have some calming music or something in your ear while you are out. [seeker] That's actually a really good idea. Distractions definitely seem to be the way to go for me. [seeker] That's probably why art helps so much [supporter] I found that distractions were great for me too! [seeker] I wonder if it should be calming music or music that I generally feel like dancing too [seeker] I know that sometimes calming music kinda makes me more centered and aware of myself which can exacerbate the problems sometimes. [seeker] I usually listen to music loudly when Im in my car to help with the anxiety [seeker] Of course, I always think its working then I get to the store and my hands hurt from gripping my steering wheel so hard XD [supporter] Whatever music you think would be best would be a good idea. [seeker] I think a lot of my anxiety doesnt stem from social stuff but from a fear of death tbh [seeker] What other distractions can you reccomend? [seeker] *recommend [supporter] Do you have a stress ball or something you can keep with you in your pocket while out? [seeker] I don't! [supporter] I think picking up one of those and having it with you might also help!",4,B

I usually only just reach out if the job listed a HR person contact [seeker] But so far I haven't get any reply from these people.   Perhaps they got a lot of messages.

I don't know if it's something she's considered, because I've expressed interest in moving to the northwest just for fun, but I've also noted that the schools I'm actually looking at are Arizona and New Mexico. I do think the field she wants to go into could be applicable in almost any state, but I'll be gentle. I don't want to lose her, so if I need to look into a different section of my field, I definitely could.

I can see you have really shown maturity in learning from your experiences. [seeker] it's easy to settle when you're attracted to the guy. I have learned a lot from my past. [seeker] I'm afraid the two might find out about each other. Not sure if it's a good thing or not [supporter] From what I've seen having confidence in yourself and what you feel in your heart won't lie. [seeker] do you think it's good if they find out about each other? sometimes guys try harder when they know there is competition. sometimes it makes them run the other way [supporter] Do you think one may have jealousy and get aggressive if he finds out?  It's a personal decision that takes some thought. [seeker] honestly im not sure. there is always that risk when doing that with guys. i better think long and hard before doing that! [supporter] It sounds like you put a lot of thought into things which can be helpful in decision making. [seeker] i think so. keeps me out of some potential messes [supporter] Can I help you with anything else?",4,B

Based on who they let go, I think I'll be next because of tenure and experience level. [supporter] So would it appear that they are laying off the people who have been there the shortest time first? [seeker] Well it's a mix of tenure and department. They also furloughed another 10% of the workforce as well so we're 20% smaller now [supporter] I know this is a terrible time to be laid off from your job. Do you feel that you have a contingency plan if you are one of those who is laid off? [seeker] No and we are in a worse position. My wife was laid off from her job 3 months ago. I'm the only breadwinner right now [supporter] Oh my goodness. Will either of you be able to claim unemployment while you search for new jobs? My brother was recently laid off and he's considering out of state options to hopefully find a job sooner. While that's certainly not an option for everyone, his unemployment is helping to keep his family afloat. [seeker] Yeah my wife filed and we just started getting it but it's nowhere what she was making of course. But yeah we can at least pay the electric bill and stuff. [supporter] Ok, well that's one small thing to help. Are you a renter or owner? As there are a few programs available to help with mortgage payments. [seeker] I'm an owner. What kind of programs? [supporter] Check on the government page for your state. It's usually your state.gov  an example is Utah.gov. Google it. Most states have aid available but a lot of people just aren't aware of it. [seeker] oh ok that's a good point. I will definitely go look for it after this discussion [supporter] I hope you can find the assistance you need. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",4,B

But being as the holiday season is upon us. I do knwo there are several stores hiring for seasonal help. Also, Amazon is hiring for customer services reps to work from home I've heard.

[supporter] How about starting with just doing the dishes, or wiping down the counter? [seeker] That would be a simple goal, I could try for that, I think maybe I should make my first goal to find an online therapist with a sliding fee scale. Do you know if there are any kind of directories for online therapists? [seeker] How long did it take for you to start to feel better after you started to get  help? [supporter] Yes i think that would be a great first step. I would try a google search like ""Therapists (My Area) Sliding Scale"" [supporter] As for feeling better its different for everyone. I think it even took a couple months to recognize myself as worthy. Once you start feeling better about yourself it kind of snowballs in a good way.",5,B

[supporter] I had a friend once that was acting out of character. They weren't quiet but I could tell them here was something different in the way they were acting etc. It turns out that they had started a new relationship with another friend of mine and didn't want anyone else to know. In reality everything was fine. There was an explainable reason behind the behaviour and it was nothing bad in the end. [seeker] Perhaps I am worried about nothing and your experience does make sense. I may be reading too much into these things but you read about people's mental health being affected by COVID isolation these days. [supporter] That is true. Mental health issues have increased  significantly since lockdowns began [supporter] As they are not responding to your attempts to get in touch, you could think has anything else changed for them other than lockdown, for example are they busier at work? have childcare commitments?

[seeker] To me we were fighting a lot, and about dumb stuff like whether or not a salad is a meal. [seeker] And I realized that we were fighting so much because I wanted him to eat healthier and be healthier and he was not going to change and it wasn't even right for me to change him if he didn't want help. [seeker] So, I am sure he felt attacked and unattractive and so he lashed out at me. [supporter] Realizing someone isn't the same you fell in love with seems valid.

[seeker] Really am not feeling well, am not able to handle my stress [supporter] I'm so sorry to hear that! Is there anything specific going on that is stressing you out? [seeker] covid 19 [supporter] It sounds to me like COVID-19 in general is causing you a lot of stress. Does this sound accurate to you? [seeker] yes because of my age and low immunity level [supporter] I also have a compromised immune system, so I understand where you're coming from. All of this has been very scary. [seeker] yes moreover i am living alone, for my job and needs i need to take care of myself [supporter] I know it's tough, but I believe that if we all keep working together and talking through our feelings, we can make it through this! [seeker] But when i see social media and News every day it increasing my stress level [supporter] I live alone as well and also need to take care of myself. It can be so hard at times. [supporter] I found that spending less time on social media and less time watching the news has helped my anxiety level to an extent. I don't think you should completely stop listening to what's going on as it's important to stay informed, but for me, limiting the amount of time that I spend engaging in these activities really helped. [supporter] Have you thought about limiting how much time you spend tuning into news sources and especially on social media? I know it's hard because there isn't much to do. [seeker] yes but what can i do if am not spending time on it [seeker] there is not much option now i can't go out also [supporter] Have you considered spending your time engaging in other hobbies? I've been doing a lot of arts and crafts (one in particular called diamond painting that can be ordered directly from Amazon) and also reading novels that I can also have delivered right to my door. This also prevents me from having to go out in public. [supporter] Talking to me about how you're feeling is a great start! I'm proud of you for being open and honest about what's going on in your head. It's very easy for people to get stuck inside of their own minds right now. [supporter] Another suggestion I've been mentioning to others suffering from the mental stressors that COVID-19 is causing is considering speaking to an outpatient/occupational therapist.

[supporter] I would personally try to write a letter and post it through their door, give them 24 hours to be able to read it and think about it.

If they continue to be noisy the next day, you should definitely call the police. The police are there for law and order, and it sounds as though they are causing a public nuisance which is what the police are there to do, no matter how troublesome your neighbours are. They aren't above the law. [seeker] i cannot write a letter because they will not understand since they dont speak english much, [seeker] Again, the police don't wat to get involved, [seeker] thank you for your input but i dont think i have anymore option but move and sell my house, [seeker] I just think that getting away from them would help [supporter] I understand you feel helpless, but I really think that is the last option.

But at least it's happening with my other friends too lol.  Gravity is a bitch! [seeker] what age group are you in? [supporter] I am nearly 50 as well. People over 50s looks better and I am sure your appearance is good as well. It is just thinking. [seeker] hmm yes....my attitude and self defeating thoughts....i need to work on that, thank you for your encouragement [supporter] It is all inside and outside appearance doesnt matter [seeker] You know you're right there [supporter] All people over 50s are graceful - honest opinion. [seeker] maybe it's like a lot of things for me, that always seem worse until i try them, then i'm like ""what was I so worried about"" [supporter] No worries about anything and enjoy life. [supporter] 100% agreed - Initially, all looks difficult but by the time all becomes easy and we become so used to it. [seeker] first world pandemic problems lol [seeker] i can't wait to have meetings in person again, so much better than zoom [supporter] yes this will be over soon and we are also used to it.

I am too shy to go on camera for my zoom meetings.   And afraid to be rejeected once i am ready to date again.",4,5.0,5.0,3.0,"[seeker] Hello [supporter] Hell, How can I help? [seeker] I'm ashamed of how I look which makes me anxious when I have to attend zoom meetings, I have to leave my camera off.  It feels like cheating! [seeker] I am badly in need of a haircut due to the pandemic...my short layered hair is now shoulder length shag lol...I hate the way I look right now and it gets me down. [supporter] Initially, I used to feel like that and never shared my camera but I know I can do all the time. [seeker] oh really?  how long did it take you to get up the nerve....its been months and months of mic only for me lol...and the silly thing is the people i'm zooming with aren't particularly attractive so I shouldn't feel ashamed. [supporter] When I saw many people were sharing camera and they didnt care about anything - few sitting in room full of mess but they dint care. [seeker] in person i am much more confidant...would like to care less. [seeker] care less about being on cam i mean [seeker] some people look so comfortable and relaxed!  I just get seized up with anxiety [supporter] correct - it is just our mind thing which stops us not to share but once you start sharing you will feel confident. [supporter] Once you dont care what people think you will be more confident. [supporter] You will also be used to it [seeker] maybe i should take the plunge...it seems so silly to me because logically i am not in these meetings to impress anyone [seeker] maybe i'll pick the least threatening meeting and start there...one that's a smaller group [supporter] You can also try different backgrounds in Zoom which will improve the way you will look. [seeker] oh really?  I haven't experimented with that.   maybe I can get a friend to practise that with me [seeker] that's a good idea [supporter] Correct - you can start with your colleagues and then slowly you will start sharing in other meetings.

Do you think that could help you feel more positively about what those closest to you are saying so much with regards to looks? [seeker] I could try. Do I need to say positive things about my looks or can they be about other stuff? [supporter] Since you are stating that you are concerned about how you look, you should just find a few positive statements with regards to your looks you think about yourself and repeat them. So if you don't think you need to lose weight, you can say something like, ""I like my weight."" or ""I don't need to lose weight."" If you think you are beautiful or pretty, you can say ""I am beautiful."" My three affirmations I use for myself are: I am beautiful, smart, and funny. I say this over and over again until my anxiety has left me. [seeker] That sounds easy enough. I will definitely try it. It will take my mind off of worrying about what they are thinking.

[seeker] I'm doing well with work after work my focus becomes my boyfriend coming back from work [supporter] After you get home, you focus on your boyfriend when he comes home from work. Do I understand correctly? [seeker] yes [seeker] I work from home [seeker] I live with my boyfriend at hotel [seeker] we've been together for over 5 years [supporter] Ok. So you are having some conflict with your boyfriend? [seeker] yes I have been and it's not new issues [supporter] Are the issues about money? Work? Many different things? [seeker] I don't know when he exactly comes back from work [seeker] I would like to know when he exactly finishes working [supporter] Ok. So you would like to have more information about his schedule and when you will be together with him. Is that correct? [seeker] Supposingly he's staying at work after work having drinks with co workers [seeker] He does this often [supporter] Ok. He is socializing with his co-workers and you would prefer that he come home and spend time with you. Is that right? [seeker] I would like him to give us more time [supporter] Ok. Socializing with co-workers is sometimes part of the job. Of course, your relationship with him is much more important, or it should be to him. What does he say when you talk to him about this? [seeker] I don't mind him staying late at the job sometimes but it seems like everyday he's socializing with his work buddies [supporter] Ok. By the way, do you have friends that you could socialize with? I understand that you want to spend time with him, but what other people do you have in your life? [seeker] I've mentioned to him about it and he always say that he will try to be back earlier , he gives a time he will be back, he says okay he will stop the drinking so much but he can't keep his word [seeker] I really don't 
have anyone to physically hangout with [supporter] Ok. Do you enjoy chatting with people online? You seem to chat well with me, so I think that you could connect with others virtually. [seeker] it's always been a struggle to make new friends to hang out with [supporter] Hobbies are a good way to connect with people. What do you like to do? [seeker] after high school it has been a struggle to meet new people to hang out [seeker] I tend to just hang out with new people I meet probably once and never see them again [supporter] Ok. My suggestions is that you find a friend or two to connect with virtually or physically. Perhaps joining a club, a gym or a class would help. This is one way for you to gain control of the situation. [seeker] I used to enjoy Zumba since I like dancing , I spend most my freetime watching movies and different series on Netflix also like to watch the home remodeling shows [supporter] Passive entertainment is not bad, but it does not help you make friends.

I can only speak to my line manager and then she speaks to higher management. [supporter] Your manager sounds unsympathetic. That's very frustrating. A lot of people are in your situation in this pandemic: too much work, not enough help. [supporter] Do you want to leave the company? Look for greener pastures? [seeker] I have been keeping an eye out for other jobs, but like you say things are difficult just now with the pandemic, there isn't a lot out there! [supporter] Very true. Have you talked to your co-workers about this issue? What do they think? [seeker] They are all feeling stretched as well so they understand. I am trying to not talk about it too much with them, I don't want to be seen as the person who's always complaining! [supporter] Yeah, that's a good point. A little complaining is ok, but a lot can get on people's nerves. [supporter] They want to be sympathetic, but after a while, they just get tired of you. [seeker] Yeah, I don't want them all to stop talking to me cause they find me annoying! I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard some days! As much as I try to start the day in a positive frame of mind it quickly gets sucked out of me! [supporter] What do you do outside of work? Hobbies and such. [seeker] At the moment I'm not getting outside as much as I should, I do enjoy gaming but it's hard to find time. I've been working 14 hour days all week! My boyfriend tries to tell me to switch off but it's hard when I know there's all this work waiting to be done. [supporter] You could try setting aside an evening or two a week for time with your BF. Just walk out of the office. Try to set some boundaries. [supporter] That might seem dangerous and risky, but sometimes it's important to set boundaries.

[seeker] Yeah, he says the same kind of thing, that I need to be firmer and just leave when I'm due to. I guess the only way for them to truely see is for the work to just not get done as there's no time! [supporter] From what you're saying, it sounds like you think you have no power. Is that true? Are you really powerless in this situation? Do not underestimate your power over your life. [seeker] I guess I do feel powerless, I feel like they never really listen to what I'm saying, they just act as if they are but then ignore me. [supporter] It sounds like the managers are training you to be resigned to your fate. If they listen to you, it encourages you to complain. If they ignore you, you go away and leave them alone. However, if you leave work early (after 9 hours, say), then they might notice you. Are you willing to take a risk?",5,B

[supporter] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? [seeker] Yes that is correct [supporter] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It's like living alone in the forest. [seeker] I know I'm not alone and that's what makes it hard to reach out, because I don't want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there's.  It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. [supporter] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. [supporter] It seems that you don't want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person. [seeker] I just don't know what to do about it anymore [seeker] Yes, I don't like to bother others or let other people down [supporter] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. [supporter] Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? [supporter] Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think? [seeker] It is a lot, I'm used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself.  I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease.  I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started. [seeker] Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief [supporter] I'm sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now. [seeker] I'd be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity. [supporter] I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air? [supporter] Oh, then drive around might be the only option [seeker] I'm hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it's not quite warn yet being in the northeast [supporter] Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern [seeker] I did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn't as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february [supporter] Does where you live have a online social activity group on FB or an app called Neighbors? [supporter] That could be a good way to communicate with others in a safe way.",5,B

We tried virtual, but it takes time and its not really intimate. [supporter] It sounds like you are basically living in a long distance relationship, given the circumstances. [supporter] It's very hard to make a relationship work when you can't see each other in person. It takes a lot of effort. [seeker] I think thats the main issue, I'm trying to make it work and I think she is as well; but its hard. I'm not sure what to do. How to cope? [supporter] Do you think she shares your frustration and concern, and if so, have you talked about it with her? [seeker] We talked about it briefly, but havent spoke about in great detail. I'm just scared, that if we do, maybe we realize its not worth it and breakup. [supporter] How much of this distance between you do you think is related to COVID measures? [seeker] It is a major issue since we live in NY and NJ, they are strict about lockdown and closing everything. I think its mostly work schedules
, we become to tired to video chat. I feel video chatting takes more effort than just being together naturally. [supporter] Video chatting definitely isn't the same, or natural. It does take more effort, certainly. [supporter] How much did you see each other before COVID? [seeker] A few times a week. 
Do you recommend anything? Just have the talk and accept whatever happens. I just dont want to keep on wondering. [supporter] A lot of relationships right now are in ""survival mode"" due to the pandemic. The only way to make it through is with a lot of effort. This lockdown isn't going to last forever. You just have to make it through. [supporter] I would definitely suggest you talk to her and make sure you're on the same page, even if that's scary. [supporter] If she knows you want to find a way to make things work, then she'll work harder, too. [seeker] Yeah I understand, maybe I should put in more effort because I have less of the crazy schedule. Maybe send her things or send her messages. I feel that she is just working too hard, and maybe is tired and cant make the effort. i should be there and support her virtually if thats what it takes. [supporter] I know you can just about anything delivered out there. I think a gesture of something tangible would be a good idea, whatever it might be. Maybe delivery of flowers and a pizza? [seeker] I think thats a good idea, I can do that. Maybe be make her day and feel
 better. [seeker] Thank you for helping, I probably thought too much of the situation and I'll put in the effort to make it work! [seeker] Feel a lot better now. [supporter] Just look for ways to stay connected and you'll make it through!",5,B

[seeker] I'm overly anxious and feeling depressed about work. [supporter] What is happening at work that makes you feel likes that? [seeker] I just feel like im not getting the support I need. [seeker] I'm relatively new at my job, so I go to the more senior staff for advice, but I seldom ever get help. [supporter] I see, is there anyone you could talk to at work that could possibly help you? [seeker] I have a couple of coworkers that have been helpful, but we don't always work together. And their help isn't always the best, or the type of support I am looking for. [supporter] I can see how that would be difficult. [supporter] Maybe if there is something specific  you need help with, you could ask a coworker or senior staff. [seeker] Yeah, it has been very difficult. Do you have any reccomendations? Or what would you do in the situation? [seeker] I generally do do that. Sometimes I get the help I need, others not so much. So i feel like im second guessing myself a lot, which puts me under a lot of stress. [supporter] Since you are relatively new it is understandable that it may be difficult.  I would see if there is someone I could confide in.  They may be understanding. [seeker] I think thats a good idea. I am concerned it may not work out. What would i do then? [supporter] Is there something specific you are feeling you need more help with?  Maybe the people you are asking do not understand exactly what  you need help with. [seeker] Decision making and the little details are where I am struggling. I've had adequate training, but i still feel as though I lack the expertise needed to do my job well. Someimtes I get the support I need, and other times i don't. I'm wondering what i should do in times where I am not getting the support I need if its not available. [supporter] That is understandable.  I have been in situations where I had to make difficult decisions at my job too.  Overtime you will be gaining experience and it will most likely get easier or you'll get better. [seeker] Yeah, you're right. I think it will just take time for me to get comfortable and gain confidence in my abilities. [supporter] If there are situations you've found difficult, maybe you could practice making decisions in those circumstances, or ask coworkers what they have done in those times as well. [seeker] That is a great suggestion [supporter] You seem to care about this job and your performance.  I believe you will gain experience and confidence will come with it. [seeker] Yeah, youre right.
